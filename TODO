- Kubernetes pod resource for the equipment
  - Should make product look sexy
- Send/receive UDP within process()
- Latency calculation
    - Send 8 byte timestamp in nanoseconds with each packet
    - https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html
    - start.elapsed().as_nanos()
- Packet header (64 bits)
    - 48 bit nanosecond timestamp
        - relative to offset negotiated over TCP
        - requires reset every 72 hours
    - 1 bit reset timestamp
        - if high, the timestamp will reset soon
        - will continue to be high after reset
        - must be set to low by driver (acknowledgment)
        - failing to set to set to low in time causes exception
    - 7 bits status
        - total of 128 possible phase status values
        - plenty room for extensibility, custom values
        - spec can require action over TCP in response to status
        - failure to comply with spec causes exception
    - 8 bits reserved
        - assists with memory alignment
        - any ideas?
- Ensure streams are aligned in memory as early as possible
